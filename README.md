### Hello

This was a small challenge completed on the Makers bootcamp.
The challenge focused on TDD and proram deisgn for a single class program.

The brief was to deisgn a single class program against the below user brief.

_" As a user<br>
So that I can keep track of my music listening<br>
I want to add tracks I've listened to and see a list of them. "_

A program 'recipe' was completed.

A program 'recipe' was created. This recipe was then used to write tests for the proposed program. The program was then built up gradually by checking it against the written tests.

After all tests were working the code was refactored to make it more readable and efficient.

Pytest can be ran from within the main folder.

The programme recipe (recipe.md) can be found in the main folder.
