### Hello

This was a small challenge completed on the Makers bootcamp.

The brief was to deisgn a single class program against the below user brief.

_" As a user<br>
So that I can keep track of my music listening<br>
I want to add tracks I've listened to and see a list of them. "_

A program 'recipe' was completed.

This 'recipe' was used to create test cases for the class.

The class was then built up gradually in stages using the written tests.
